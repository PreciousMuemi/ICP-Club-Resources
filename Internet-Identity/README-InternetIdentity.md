# INTERNET IDENTITY

# Introduction to Internet Identity (II) on ICP  

## What is Internet Identity (II)?  
**Internet Identity (II)** is a privacy-preserving, **blockchain-based authentication system** developed for the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It allows users to sign in to decentralized applications (dApps) without usernames, passwords, or third-party identity providers.  

## Why is it Important?  
- **User Privacy**: Eliminates reliance on centralized identity providers (Google, Facebook, etc.).  
- **Passwordless Authentication**: Uses cryptographic key pairs instead of traditional passwords.  
- **Security & Anonymity**: Ties authentication to user devices, ensuring secure and private access.  
- **Decentralization**: Operates fully on-chain, ensuring trustless identity management.  

# How Internet Identity Works on ICP  

## Authentication Mechanism  
Internet Identity is built on **WebAuthn (a W3C standard)** and **Threshold Cryptography**. Hereâ€™s how it works:  

- **Device-Based Authentication**: Users register their device (laptop, smartphone, security key, etc.) as an identity anchor.  
- **WebAuthn & Biometrics**: Uses biometric authentication (Face ID, fingerprint) or hardware keys (YubiKey, TPM).  
- **Delegation System**: When a user logs in, a temporary key is generated and signed by the Internet Identity canister.  
- **No Tracking**: Internet Identity generates a different identity for each dApp, preventing cross-app tracking.  

## Key Features of ICPâ€™s Internet Identity  
- **Device-bound authentication**: Instead of passwords, II uses FIDO-compatible devices (biometric sensors, security keys).  
- **Anonymized User Identifiers (Delegated Identities)**: Each dApp gets a unique identity per user, preventing correlation between different services.  
- **Secure Recovery Methods**: Users can add multiple devices or backup security keys for account recovery.  

# Where Internet Identity is Used on ICP  

## dApps & Smart Contracts  
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Secure access to on-chain financial services.  
- **Web3 Social Platforms**: Anonymous, private logins for decentralized social networks.  
- **NFT Marketplaces**: Secure transactions and ownership verification.  
- **DAO Governance**: Sign and vote in decentralized governance without revealing personal identity.  

## Access Control & Authentication  
- **Developer Portals**: Login authentication for ICP developers deploying canisters.  
- **Enterprise & IoT Solutions**: Secure interactions with Web3-based business applications.  

# Security & Privacy Advantages of ICPâ€™s Internet Identity  

## Privacy-Preserving Features  
- **No Data Leaks**: No personal data stored on centralized servers.  
- **Unique Anonymous IDs**: Different IDs for different applications prevent tracking.  
- **Decentralized Security**: Cryptographic authentication prevents phishing and credential leaks.  

## Resilience Against Attacks  
- **No Phishing Risks**: Eliminates passwords, making credential phishing impossible.  
- **Quantum-Secure Cryptography**: ICP is designed with future-proof security measures.  
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Decentralized authentication reduces centralized attack risks.  

# How to Set Up Internet Identity on ICP
[Internet Identity Documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/web-authentication-identity/)

## Step 1: Visit the Official Internet Identity Portal  
The easiest way to create an Internet Identity is through the official ICP website.  

-Go to the Internet Identity Portal at [https://identity.internetcomputer.org/](https://identity.internetcomputer.org/).

## Step 2: Set Up a New Identity  
Once on the portal:  
- Click "Create New Identity". This process will generate a new identity for you.  
- You'll be prompted to choose between various authentication methods, such as:  
  - **Hardware Authentication** (e.g., using a device like a YubiKey)  
  - **Face or Fingerprint recognition** (using your device's biometric capabilities)  
  - **Password & Recovery Phrase** (traditional method)

## Step 4: Receive Your Identity Anchor
After successfully authenticating, you will receive an Identity Anchor (e.g., `123456`).
Important: Write down this Identity Anchor somewhere safe, as it is required to log in from other devices.

## Step 5: Add Backup Devices (Optional but Recommended)
To avoid losing access, add a backup method:

  - Register another device (e.g., another phone, laptop).
  - Register a security key as a backup.
This allows you to recover access in case your primary device is lost.

## Step 6: Start Using Your Internet Identity
Now that you have created your Internet Identity, you can use it to log in to dApps on the Internet Computer (ICP).

  - Visit any ICP-powered dApp that supports Internet Identity (e.g., DSCVR, OpenChat, Distrikt, NNS).
  - Select "Login with Internet Identity" and enter your Identity Anchor.
  - Authenticate with your registered device, and youâ€™re in! ðŸŽ‰

## Additional Steps (If Needed)
  - **Recover Identity**: If you lose access, use your backup device or security key to recover your account.
  - **Manage Devices**: You can add/remove devices from the Internet Identity settings.
